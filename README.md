# CLoudify
This is a second take on the idea of turning an old laptop or computer into a Cloud server. <br />
(Old project was LAN_Cloud but I deleted the repository) <br />
<br />

## Dependancies
python 3.7+ (Some older versions will propably work fine as wel)

[Socket](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html)


## installation
Download the latest version from the releases tab to be sure to have a working version.
put the server package on your old laptop or computer and run the __init__.py file from there.

<< Client installation instructions will follow >>
